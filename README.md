Welcome to the coding assessment! This is a simple 5 question quiz to assess your knowledge in the basics of javascript programming. 
After begining the assessment, you will have 75 seconds to complete each question. Each correct answer will add to your overall score. 
Each incorrect answer will remove 10 seconds from the remaining time. The test is completed after all questions are answered, or the timer runs out.
If there is still time remaining after all the questions are answered, your score will receive a multiplier proportional to the number of seconds left.
Have fun!
